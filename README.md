# Purdue Bell Tower in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

The Purdue Bell Tower was not included in the default Bing 3D photogrammetry. This package is a 3D model imported from Google Maps, processed in Blender, and exported for MSFS.

## Time for Takeoff

Fly out of Purdue University (KLAF) and let the bell tower help you find your way!

## The Bell Tower Curse

While walking underneath the bell tower is strongly discouraged, I definitely do not recommend trying to fly under it.


## Other Information

The bell tower was created with the help of Google Maps, [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org), and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), converted with the Blender Plugins: [Blender2MSFS](https://www.fsdeveloper.com/forum/resources/blender2msfs-toolkit.256/) and [MapsModelImporter](https://github.com/eliemichel/MapsModelsImporter). Shoutout to YouTuber [Flying Theston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdCP11rqpVk) for providing a great video on importing these models to MSFS. 


Enjoy, and Boiler Up!
